        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Lasagna Recipe is easy to make with a creamy ricotta cheese mixture, savory meat sauce, and mozzarella
            cheese.
            BONUS: it's make-ahead and freezer-friendly!</p>
        <h2>Ingradients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>15 oz. ricotta cheese, 2 cups</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>¾ cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ tsp pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the ricotta cheese mixture in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows
                them to release a
                little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so
                that it’s very
                fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute.
                Drain excess
                grease.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. Add the
                marinara sauce,
                tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover
                partially and let the
                sauce simmer gently.</li>
        </ol>
