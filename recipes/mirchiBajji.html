            <li>¾ cup Gram Flour</li>

            <li>Oil for deep frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a mixing bowl add gram flour, turmeric powder, red chilli powder and salt as needed, mix well.
            </li>
            <li>Add water in small quantities and mix until the batter is thick. Add a pinch of cooking soda just before
                frying the
                bajjis, mix well.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile heat a pan with oil for deep frying. Once oil is hot, set it on medium flame. Dip each green
                chilli in the
                bajji batter and coat it on all sides.</li>
            <li>Hold and lift it at the stem, after dripping off excess batter drop it gently into the hot oil.
                Fry the bajji one or two at a time without overcrowding the pan. Turn it around to cook until golden
                brown on all sides.
                If the bajji is changing color quickly, reduce the flame to ensure even cooking all the way through.
            </li>
            <li>To serve the bajjis, slit them at the center and stuff with finely chopped onions. Sprinkle red chilli
                powder on top and
                just before serving, drizzle lemon juice all over. Serve hot with coffee/tea</li>
        </ol>
