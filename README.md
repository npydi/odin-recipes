Our first project will require you to draw on your new understanding of working with media by building YouTube's video player page .

The goal here is not to produce an exact replica of the YouTube video page, but to focus on making the media elements show up. That means two things 
-- embedding the YouTube video player into the page so it actually plays and showing little thumbnail images along the right side.
